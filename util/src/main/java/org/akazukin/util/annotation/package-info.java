/**
 * This package contains annotations for documenting and defining the behavior
 * and properties of classes and fields at a design level.
 *
 * <p>
 * The annotations in this package are designed to improve code clarity and maintainability
 * by providing meaningful markers for properties like immutability, mutability,
 * thread-safety, and unique identification. These annotations are retained at the CLASS level,
 * making them available in the compiled class files but not accessible via runtime reflection.
